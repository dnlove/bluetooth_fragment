This is a Bluetooth API for sending and receiving.  It shows you how to send data between two devices as well as how to do packet fragmentation.  I originally implemented this for CCN project, but I hope it'll be useful for anyone doing Bluetooth programming.

Instructions:

1) Go to {send_ccn_over_bt_rec} in {bt.c} and change the host and guest address accordingly.  For example, on machine A, set destination address to B, and vice versa.
2) Compile: gcc -o bt bt.c -lbluetooth
You may need to install some Bluetooth libraries before compiling.
